              Hello, I’m Andrew Pollack-Gray! I like the parts of software that make
              everything else possible: build systems, infrastructure, CI/CD, and the
              invisible mechanics of developer productivity.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/">Anyscale</a> as
              part of the Release and Engineering Efficiency (REEf) team.
            </p>

            <p>
              Outside of work, I play the Euphonium and try to get better at cooking.
              I also love to tinker with personal automations on a
              <a href="https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure?tab=readme-ov-file#pi-infrastructure">
                Raspberry Pi cluster
              </a>.
              My favorite is a series of
              <a href="https://github.com/andrewpollack/pi-infrastructure?tab=readme-ov-file#meals-go--meals-frontend/">
                grocery list automations
              </a>
              that my wife and I use all the time. This type of automation brings me endless joy.
